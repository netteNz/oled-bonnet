# Animation engine — phase & session tracker

Tracks progress against the original handoff (animation engine for the
2.23" SSD1305 OLED, 128x32). See `README.md` for the repo layout and
`BENCH.md`/`NOTES.md` for the underlying data.

## Phase status

| Phase | What | Status | Artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Benchmark first | Done | `bench.py`, `BENCH.md` |
| 1 | Driver probe | Partial | `NOTES.md` (addressing, column offset, `write_cmd`). `hw_scroll_spike.py` not written. |
| 2 | Packed-tape core | Not started | — needs `oled_hud/pack.py` (MVLSB via `numpy.packbits`), `oled_hud/tape.py` |
| 3 | Partial-window blitter | Done | `oled_hud/driver.py` (`PartialSSD1305.blit()`) |
| 4 | Effects & scheduling | Not started | — needs `oled_hud/clock.py` (`FrameClock`), `oled_hud/effects.py` |

## Acceptance criteria (from handoff)

- [x] `bench.py` numbers recorded in `BENCH.md` (full-frame at 100kHz/1MHz, partial blit at 1MHz)
- [ ] Ticker runs 60+ char string with mean `FrameClock` slack > 0 — no ticker built yet
- [ ] Zero Pillow/font calls in frame path — no frame-path code exists yet to check
- [x] Partial blit measurably faster than full `show()` for a 2-page region (recorded in `BENCH.md`)
- [ ] Ticker runs 30+ min without drift/leak/I2C errors

## Session log

### 2026-09 — session 1
- Wrote `bench.py`, ran it at 100kHz and 1MHz (Phase 0).
- Wrote `oled_hud/driver.py` (`PartialSSD1305.blit()`) (Phase 3).
- Commit: `a2145c2` "Add I2C benchmark harness and partial-blit OLED driver".

### 2026-09-13 — session 2
- Read `adafruit_ssd1305` source to confirm addressing mode, column offset
  (4, not 0 — SSD1305 ≠ SSD1306), and `write_cmd` visibility; wrote it up
  in `NOTES.md` (Phase 1, partial — no `hw_scroll_spike.py` yet).
- Built `walk.py`: a stick-figure sprite that walks/bounces across the
  display using `blit()`, packing frames with a hand-rolled, pure-Python
  MVLSB packer. This is a prototype outside the formal phase structure —
  it validates `blit()` ergonomics on real hardware but is **not** Phase 2:
  it doesn't use `numpy.packbits`, isn't in the `oled_hud` package, and
  uses `time.sleep()` per frame rather than `FrameClock`. Confirmed working
  live on hardware (clean start/stop, screen clears on exit).
- Created this file and `NOTES.md`.

## Next up

Phase 2 (`oled_hud/pack.py` + `oled_hud/tape.py`) is the next gating piece
per the handoff — Phase 4's ticker/effects work assumes it exists.
